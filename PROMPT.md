## Home page design and content
Help me design create a modern look dark theme company frontpage which introduce the following concept:
- "Today, just seconds of your voice are enough for GenAI to clone it and make you say anything. We safeguard your most valuable asset — your voice — with cutting-edge audio protection technology." 


- "The Audionyx watermarking technology embeds robust, invisible markers into every voice and sound, ensuring creators can prove ownership, stop AI misuse, and protect their digital identity with confidence." 

- "Our audio database powers next-generation multi-media indexing by storing unique, traceable identifiers for every piece of content. This enables fast, accurate search and verification across massive libraries, ensuring creators and platforms can reliably track, organize, and protect their audio assets at scale."  

- "With every piece of audio can be inserted with trackable identity, the media creator can be fear free for voice stolen. The media content consumer would have a way to check for reliable media source. The media platform would be able to prevent content mis-use with our technology.
